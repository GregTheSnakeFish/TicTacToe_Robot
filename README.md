# TicTacToe_Robot
(eventually) an AI that plays tic tac toe, I hope!

tictac.py just plays by randomly choosing a valid spot and hoping for the best. This is just to build the game. You can choose who goes first, and if you want to replay. You need to restart the program to play again while changing who goes first.

tictac_working copy.py is just the bare-bones project before I implemented anything extra to make sure the good raw code is saved if I mess it up later.
